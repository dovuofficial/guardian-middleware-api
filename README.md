# Guardian Middleware API

## Developing and testing locally

### Setup your environment variables

You can copy `env.example` to get you going

```
cp env.example .env.local
```

Make sure to have the Guardian API running locally and then fill out the `GUARDIAN_API_URL` with the correct URL in your `.env.local` file.

For example:

```
GUARDIAN_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/v1
```

### Running the API

Run yarn and then start the development server. This will default to localhost:3000 but will increment if that port is already busy.

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### Run the linter, formatter and basic tests

```bash
yarn lint
yarn format
yarn test
yarn types
```

All the above can be run together using

```bash
yarn ci
```

If you want to run all the tests, including the e2e tests for your config use:

```bash
yarn test:all
```

### Postman

A Postman collection is included at the root of the repositorty which will allow you to start testing endpoints. The Postman file includes autogenerated HMAC headers for all requests and will also store the Bearer JWT of the last created/logged in account. All requests will then use this JWT in their Authorization header.

## Typescript and the Open API Spec

The types for the API are autogenerated based on the Open API spec found at `/src/spec/openapi.json`.

When adding a new route follow these steps:

1. Update the Open API JSON spec to describe the new route
2. Run `yarn codegen` ( which uses [openapi-typescript](https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-typescript)) to auto generate the Typescript definitions at `/src/spec/openapi.ts`
3. Add the new route to `pages/api/` and supply the required middleware for the route
4. Add a new handler for the route in `src/handlers/`
5. If required, create a new validator for the input in `/src/validators/`

This flow allows us to have a strong contract between the Open API spec and the API types. Typescript checks should avoid issues of the API moving out of sync with the documentation.

## Security

Every request apart from `api/status` and `api/docs` should include HMAC authentication. We follow Microsoft's HMAC implementation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/rest-api-authentication-hmac) with a couple of simplifications.

### Required Headers

-   `host`: string - "example.com"
-   `x-date`: ISO 8601 UTC - "2022-08-01T11:06:23:1234Z"
-   `x-content-sha256`: SHA256 string - The SHA256 string of the content body
-   `x-signature`: HMAC string - The HMAC authentication string as defined below

### How to authenticate requests using HMAC

The [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/rest-api-authentication-hmac) do a good job explaining the details. The following describes the simplified implementation that we use which avoids dynamic complexities like requiring `SignedHeaders` and `Credential` headers. Also, since we require the `Authorization` header for the Guardian JWT, we instead use an `x-signature` header for passing the HMAC signed hash.

Here is an example of how to construct the required HMAC headers to make a successful request:

```js
function signRequest(
	host, // Often added to the header by default in HTTP clients - example.com
	method, // GET, PUT, POST, DELETE
	url, // path+query - /api/posts?order=asc
	body, // request body (undefined if none)
	secret // The private key used to sign the HMAC content
) {
	var verb = method.toUpperCase()
	var utcNow = new Date().toUTCString()

	// If passing body data then generate a Base64 encoded SHA256 hash
	var contentHash = Crypto.createHash('sha256')
		.update(JSON.stringify(body))
		.digest('base64')

	//
	// String to sign if including body data. We follow the `\n` and `;` delimiters inline with the Microsoft spec
	var stringToSign = `${verb}\n${url}\n${utcNow};${host};${contentHash}`

	//
	// String to sign if not including body data
	var stringToSign = `${verb}\n${url}\n${utcNow};${host}`

	//
	// Signature - Base64 encoded SHA256 HMAC signed with secret key
	var signature = Crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret)
		.update(stringToSign)
		.digest('base64')

	//
	// Result request headers
	return [
		{ name: 'host', value: host },
		{ name: 'x-date', value: utcNow },
		{ name: 'x-content-sha256', value: contentHash }, // Omit if not including body data
		{ name: 'x-signature', value: signature },
	]
}
```

## Example Flow

Assumes a Standard Registry account already exists which has published a policy.

- Create A New Registrant Account
- Create A New Verifier Account
- Assign The New Accounts To A Policy
- Login With The Registrant Account
- Submit An Application
- Login With The Standard Registry Account
- Approve The Application
- Login With The Registrant Account
- Submit An Ecological Project
- Login With The Standard Registry Account
- Approve The Ecological Project
- Login With The Registrant Account
- Submit A New MRV Request
- Login With The Verifier Account
- Approve The MRV Request

After the MRV request is approved, tokens will automatically be minted that represent the carbon described in the MRV for this Ecological Project.
